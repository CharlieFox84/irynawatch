## üß† Editorial Logic

This timeline prioritizes clarity, dignity, and restraint. Filings are tagged to reflect both legal classification and narrative significance:

- `motion`: High-impact procedural filings, including those that drew public scrutiny (e.g. medical evaluations)
- `procedural-motion`: Routine filings such as continuances or scheduling orders; hidden by default to reduce visual clutter

The toggle interface allows users to reveal procedural depth without overwhelming the default view.
