## 🧠 Editorial Logic

This timeline prioritizes clarity, dignity, and restraint. Filings are tagged to reflect both legal classification and narrative significance:

- `motion`: High-impact procedural filings, including those that drew public scrutiny (e.g. medical evaluations)
- `procedural-motion`: Routine filings such as continuances or scheduling orders; hidden by default to reduce visual clutter

The toggle interface allows users to reveal procedural depth without overwhelming the default view.

- Once ready, a [pull request](https://github.com/CharlieFox84/irynawatch/compare/main...dev) is opened from `dev` to `main`.
- Merging triggers Netlify auto-deploy to [irynawatch.netlify.app](https://irynawatch.netlify.app/).
