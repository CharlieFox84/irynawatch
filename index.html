        <p>The U.S. Department of Justice filed a federal criminal complaint against Decarlos Brown Jr., charging him with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. The charge stems from the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska aboard the Lynx Blue Line in Charlotte.

        <h3>Sep 12, 2025 - Community Vigil Held</h3>
        <p>Community members gathered at Marshall Park in Charlotte to honor the life of Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally attacked aboard the Lynx Blue Line on August 22. The vigil was organized by JustUs Support Group, Moms Ain't Playin, Foundation of Donqwavias, and Survivors Outreach Ministries. Speakers remembered Iryna as a kind, hardworking young woman who had come to the U.S. from Ukraine with dreams of becoming a veterinarian. Her family's attorney described her love for animals and her younger siblings, saying, “She was a daughter. Shes a sister. She has a little brother. She has a little sister. She loved animals.”</p>
        <p>Organizers also called attention to systemic failures in public safety and accountability, stating, “Her death is not just the result of one mans knife, it is the result of a system that values ideology over safety.”</p>

        <p>Mecklenburg County GOP Chair Kyle Kirby announced a candlelight vigil to honor Iryna Zarutska, scheduled for Monday, September 22 at 8:00 p.m. at the East/West Boulevard light rail station in Charlotte. The event will mark 30 days since Iryna's death and is intended as both a memorial and a public call for accountability. Kirby urged “every able-bodied Charlottean and person in this city who is concerned about crime” to attend.</p>
        <p>During the press conference, GOP leaders criticized local justice policies and cited the suspect's prior arrests and untreated mental illness. Kirby stated, “She died because of our complacency and what we have allowed to perpetuate in the Charlotte municipal and county government.”</p>

        <h3>Sep 22, 2025 - Candlelight Vigil Held</h3>
        <p>Hundreds gathered at sunset to honor Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee fatally stabbed on the Charlotte light rail one month earlier. The vigil was organized by the Mecklenburg County GOP, West Charlotte Ministries, and local churches, and featured prayers in English and Ukrainian, songs, and moments of silence.</p>
        <p>Speakers remembered Iryna as kind, affectionate, and hopeful for a new life in the U.S. Attendees held signs reading “Remember Iryna” and placed flowers at a growing memorial.</p>
        <p>A two-minute silence marked the time before help arrived the night of her death. Community leaders called for renaming the East/West station in her honor and urged reforms to prevent future tragedies.</p>
        <p>One attendee brought her daughter's wedding flowers, saying Iryna would never experience such joy. Others traveled from out of state to pay respects, emphasizing that her death resonated far beyond Charlotte.</p>
